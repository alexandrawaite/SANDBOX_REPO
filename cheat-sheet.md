This is a cheat sheet of my favorite commands and explanations of what they do.

^U - this simple command deletes to the beginning of the line, which is a great time saver.

Option-click - this command was a revelation to me and eliminates having to hold down the arrow keys just to fix a small error in the center of the line.

man - this command displays a manual for the command that follows it. this is the most valuable command for me being new to the command line.

less - this is a great way to interactively view file contents.
  After entering the less command, these are some more useful commands to move around the file, especially handy when searching through man pages:
    G - moves to the end of a file.
    1G - move to the beginning of the file.
    /<string> - Searches file for string
    n - move to next search result
    N - move to previous search result

cmd1 | cmd2 - piping commands to each other is extremely useful and saves the time and effort of writing each out individually

grep -i <string> <file> - finds a string in a file case-insensitively.
